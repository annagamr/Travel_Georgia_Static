<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Kartuli</h2>
      <p>The most popular wedding dance which originally was not created for the stage, but it is the most popular one. From that dance derived Georgian Wedding Clothes and characteristics.
        During the dance, the man is not allowed to touch the woman and must keep a certain distance from his partner. 
        The man's upper body is motionless at all times. It shows that even in love, men must control their feelings. The man focuses on his partner as if she were the only woman in the whole world.

    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Gandagana</h2>
      <p>This dance was introduced in 1946 and was performed by a man and a woman.
          Later it changed into a group dance involving more males and females. 
          The roots of Gandagana is the cult of fertility.
          The dance is quite complex, at first the rhythm is slow, but as the dance progresses, the rhythm increases with it.
