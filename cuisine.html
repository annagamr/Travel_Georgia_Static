                <p>Guests in Georgian households are treated with respect.
                    Georgians love being hosts as far as they consider guests ot be <strong>"God-sent"</strong>.<br>
                    It is very often that guests are served amazing, home-made dishes, wine and most importantly
                    "Chacha"- which is a very popular alcoholic drink.
                    It must be noted that every region of Georgia has its own distinct style of food preparation. </p>

                    When we talk about popular drinks in Georgia, there are two things that come to mind â€“
                    <em>Chacha</em> and <em>Wine</em>.
                </h1>
                <img id="tbilisiwine" src="Photos/wine1.jpg" alt="Wine">
                <p id="afterdrink">
                    Chacha is a Georgian pomace brandy, a clear and strong (ranging between 40% alcohol for commercially
                    produced to 65% for a homebrew), which is sometimes called "Wine vodka". It is made of grape pomace
                    (grape residue left after making wine). The term chacha is used in Georgia to refer to the grape
                    distillate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, Georgian wine was listed in Guinness World Records as the oldest.
                    As reported, the oldest drink was made in Georgia 8,000 years ago.
                    This fact is confirmed by the remains of grapes in earthenware discovered during archaeological
                    excavations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The earthenware found in Georgia is the oldest wine glassware to date.

                    The country has almost 400 different kinds of grapes, only 38 of them used for wine production.

                    In Georgia, we have a totally different way of wine-making which involves pressing the grapes and
                    then pouring the juice, grape skins, stalks, and pips into the Qvevri, which is sealed and buried in
                    the ground so that the wine can ferment for five to six months before being drunk.
